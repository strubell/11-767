Lab 1: Project Brainstorming
===
The goal of this lab is for you to work as a group to brainstorm project ideas. At the end of this exercise you should have an outline for your project proposal that you can share with others to get feedback. We will share these outlines for peer feedback in the next lab.

Group members present in lab today:

1: Ideas
----
Write down 3-5 project ideas your group considered (a few sentences each). Depending on your group and process, the ideas may be very different, or they may be variations on one central idea.
 1. ...
 2. ...
 3. ...
 4. ...
 5. ...

2: Narrowing
----
Choose two of the above ideas. For each one:
1. How would this project leverage the expertise of each member of your group?
2. In completing this project, what new things would you learn about: (a) hardware (b) efficiency in machine learning (c) I/O modalities (d) other?
3. What potential road blocks or challenges do you foresee in this project? How might you adjust the project scope in case these aspects present unsurmountable challenges?
4. How could you potentially extend the scope of this project if you had e.g. one more month?


3: Outline
----
Choose one of the ideas you've considered, and outline a project proposal for that idea. This outline will be shared with other groups next class (Tuesday) to get feedback.

Your outline should include:
- Motivation
- Hypotheses (key ideas)
- How you will test those hypotheses: datasets, baselines, ablations, and other experiments or analyses.
- I/O: What are the inputs and output modalities? What existing tools will you use to convert device inputs (that are not a core part of your project) to a format readable by the model, and vice versa?
- Hardware, including any peripherals required, and reasoning for why that hardware was chosen for this project. (This is where you will request additional hardware and/or peripherals for your project!)
- Potential challenges, and how you might adjust the project to adapt to those challenges.
- Potential extensions to the project.
